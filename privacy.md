Privacy Policy for ActivStatus

Last Updated: 7-02-2025 (DD-MM-YYYY)

1. Introduction
Thank you for using ActivStatus (“the Bot”). This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, store, and disclose data when you or your Discord server use our Bot.

2. Data We Collect
   a. Webhook Information
      - **Guild ID**: Identifies the server where the Bot is installed.
      - **Channel ID**: Identifies the specific text channel in which a webhook is created.
      - **Webhook ID and Token**: Used by the Bot to send status updates to your channel via Discord’s webhook system.

No other personal or user-identifying information is collected. The Bot does **not** store usernames, message contents, or other personal data from Discord.

3. How We Use the Data
   - **Webhook Data**: Used solely to post service status updates to the correct channel in your Discord server.
   - **Game Status Data**: Used solely to determine whether a service’s status has changed (e.g., from “online” to “outage”).

4. Data Sharing
We do **not** share or sell any stored data to third parties. Collected data is only accessible to the Bot’s maintainers and stored on our secure database for the functionality of the Bot.

5. Data Retention
   - **Webhook Data**: Retained as long as your server uses our Bot. If the Bot is removed, or upon request, this data can be deleted.
   - **Game Status Data**: Retained indefinitely unless manually cleared, to ensure accurate status-tracking and prevent duplicate notifications after a Bot reboot.

6. Data Security
We employ standard security measures to protect stored data, including secure database access and restricted administrative privileges. However, no method of storage or transmission over the internet is 100% secure. We cannot guarantee absolute security.

7. Your Choices
   - **Remove the Bot**: If you wish to stop data collection, you may remove our Bot from your server. 
   - **Request Deletion**: Contact us to request removal of any stored server or webhook data.

9. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. We will notify you of any material changes by posting a new effective date at the top.

9. Contact Us
If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, or if you wish to request deletion of your data, please contact the Bot administrator or server owner via the discord (https://discord.gg/bRtYYHKZgt).

By using ActivStatus, you acknowledge that you have read and understood this Privacy Policy.
