By adding or using the Ezrinix ActivStatus bot (“the Bot”) on your Discord server, you agree to these Terms of Service. If you do not agree, please remove the Bot.

2. What the Bot Does
The Bot checks certain Activision game server statuses and posts notifications in your Discord channel via webhooks.

- Basic game info (title, platform, online/offline status).
No personal data (like usernames or messages) is collected.

4. Disclaimer
The Bot is provided “as is.” We do not guarantee it will always be accurate, uninterrupted, or error-free. You use the Bot at your own risk.

5. Removal
You can remove the Bot from your server at any time. We may also stop providing the Bot at any time without notice.

6. Changes
We may update these Terms. If we make changes, we will post the new version. Your continued use means you accept any updates.
